/**
 * Immutable snapshot of the key material extracted from a PKCS12 keystore.
 *
 * <p>Both maps are unmodifiable and populated once at cache-load time. Instances
 * of this record are safe for concurrent reads with no synchronization because:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The {@link PrivateKey} implementations used here ({@code BCRSAPrivateCrtKey}, {@code BCECPrivateKey},
 *   {@code BCFalconPrivateKey}, {@code BCMLDSAPrivateKey}, {@code BCSLHDSAPrivateKey}) store all key material
 *   in {@code byte[]} fields set at construction time. No mutable state accumulates on subsequent method calls.</li>
 *   <li>{@link PublicKey} implementations are immutable by the same verification.</li>
 *   <li>Both maps are wrapped in {@code Collections.unmodifiableMap()} and are never replaced or modified after construction.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Keys are indexed by alias, which equals {@code KeyData.name} for every entry in this connector.</p>
 *
 * <p>The underlying {@code KeyStore} is used only during construction and is immediately discarded.</p>
